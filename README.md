# UDP_packetDropping
This project was an assignment for a networking class.<br>
The Server file was provided to us.<br>
Server file was only modified slightly to work with my Client program. <br>
Ping is used to test reachability to a host on a network and works by sending a packet and waiting for a reply.<br>

For this project we were asked to create a Client for our PingServer program.<br>
The program sends 10 ping messages to the target and we were to determine and print RTT if the ping message was returned.<br>
The client should wait for one second for a reply and print out a message if the packet was lost.<br>
We were also asked to capitalize the message sent by the client and send it back<br>
